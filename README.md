# OfflineBrowserTools

The idea arose to create a simple, convenient and interesting program that would be launched from an HTML file and work offline in browsers.

In the program, the user will be able to use a random number and password generator, a day calculator and many other features (the list will be expanded).

Basic concepts of the program:
1. Everything should be in one file (scripts and styles are written in an HTML file).
2. You can work with the program without an Internet connection
